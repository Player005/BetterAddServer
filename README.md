# BetterAddServer
Minecraft Fabric 1.19 mod with some small quality-of-life-enhancements for the "add server" menu.

*"The code is messy, but it works"*

## Features
 - swap server name and server IP fields (craziest feature ever, I know)
 - automagically fill in server name
 - make server IP field actually automatically focused (instead of looking like it's focused but actually being not)


Please report any issues you may find at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Player005/BetterAddServer/issues).
Feel free to also post suggestions or to contribute code by creating a pull request.
I would highly appreciate if someone who actually knows Java / has experience with mixins reviewed the code and gave hints or even created a pull request.
