# BetterAddServer
Minecraft Fabric 1.19 mod with some small quality-of-life-enhancements for the "add server" menu.


## Features
 - swap server name and server IP fields (craziest feature ever, I know)
 - automagically fill in server name
 - make server IP field properly focused upon open
 - save on enter
