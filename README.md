# Better Server Menu / Better "Add Server"
Very small but useful Minecraft Fabric 1.19/1.20+ mod with some small quality-of-life-enhancements for the "Add Server" menu.


> *Are you tired of tens of servers in Your Server list, all using the default name "Minecraft Server"?
> Then, this is **the** mod for You!*


## Features
This mod aims to improve the usability/ comfort of the "Add Server" menu in Minecraft by:
 - saving when You press enter
 - automatically filling in the server name when you enter the IP
 - even converting names of existing servers using the default name to more recognisable ones (1.20.5+ only)

For example:
When you enter an IP address like `hypixel.net`, the mod automatically generates the server name (`Hypixel`) by omitting the domain ending (".net") and capitalising the first letter, instead of leaving the default name "Minecraft Server".

Please report any issues or incompatibilities you may find at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Player005/BetterAddServer/issues).
Feel free to also post suggestions on how this mod could be improved further, or even to contribute code by creating a pull request.
